## ðŸ“œ Body  

This Python script takes marks entered by the user (comma-separated) and:  

- Splits the input into a **list of marks**.  
- Uses Pythonâ€™s built-in `min()` function to detect the **lowest mark**.  
- Prints out the weakest score with a clean message.  

âœ¨ A quick way to learn:  
- String input handling  
- List operations  
- Built-in functions in Python

## ðŸš€ CTA  

Fork it.  

Run it.  

Expose the **lowest mark** with a single line of Python power.
